            <h2 class="section-title">The Career Switch</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Switching from <strong>firefighting</strong> to <strong>web development</strong> might seem like moving
                between two completely different worlds, which is exactly what it is. But if I'm being honest, the
                mindset I built in my past career influences my drive as a developer today.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Pressure, Calm, Problem-Solving</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Firefighting teaches you to stay calm in high pressure situations. You can't panic. You break down the
                problem, act with intention, and trust your training and instincts.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                That mindset didn't disappear when I switched careers. Now, when I'm debugging or trying to understand a
                new tool, I approach it the same way:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>Slow down</li>
                <li>Assess the situation</li>
                <li>Identify the root problem</li>
                <li>Apply the right solution</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-text">
                It's not as dramatic as responding to an emergency call, but the careful discipline still applies.
            </p>

        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Biggest Shift: From Physical to Digital</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                The biggest adjustment wasn't the difficulty, it was the <em>nature</em> of the work. Instead of working
                with equipment, hoses, or physical environments, I'm working with:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>Code</li>
                <li>Logic</li>
                <li>User interfaces</li>
                <li>Systems that live entirely on a screen</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-text">
                It required a complete mindset shift from physical reactions to mental models. But once it clicked,
                solving digital problems became just as satisfying.
            </p>

        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Why the Transition Made Sense</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                At the core, both fields are about:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>Helping people</li>
                <li>Solving problems</li>
                <li>Teamwork</li>
                <li>Staying calm under pressure</li>
                <li>Constant learning</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-text">
                That's why I fell in love with web development. It challenged me, but in a way that felt familiar, just
                with a different set of tools.

            <h2 class="section-title">Where I Am Now</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Today, I'm a junior web developer focused on building clean, modern digital experiences. The journey
                hasn't been easy, but every step has been meaningful.

                If anything, my background reminds me that:
