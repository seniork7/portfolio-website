                <p class="section-text">Public Safety is a full-stack project that provides community members with information about public safety initiatives and an easy way to apply as volunteers. The app uses a <code>React</code> frontend and an <code>Express/MongoDB</code> backend to securely collect and store volunteer applications.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Process</h2>
                <div class="section-text">
                <p>Throughout the development process, I encountered a few challenges:</p>
                    <ol class="section-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> This was my first time using <code>MongoDB</code> and <code>Mongoose</code>. Understanding <code>schemas</code>, connecting the database, handling <code>async</code> operations, and managing environment variables was initially confusing, especially when moving from local development to deployment.
                            <br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> I reviewed <code>Mongoose</code> documentation, learned how to structure a schema, and followed best practices for <code>async</code> error handling. I also learned how to keep sensitive credentials safe using environment variables instead of hardcoding them. Deployment required whitelisting server IPs in <code>MongoDB</code> Atlas and setting up the correct connection string for production.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> During development, I originally used <code>port 5000</code> for my backend, not realizing that macOS uses that port for system services. This caused random connection failures <code>(403 status)</code>, and the server wouldn’t start.
                            <br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> I changed the development port to 3000, which solved the conflict and helped me understand that certain ports are reserved or have higher chances of conflict on different operating systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> Hosting both the frontend and backend was still a bit new to me since this was my second full-stack project. Hence, I ran into some issues with missing <code>Node</code> modules, incorrect build commands, and environment variables not being detected on Render. The backend would build successfully but fail at runtime because modules weren’t installed and the database wasn't connecting.
                            <br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> I learned how hosting platforms work behind the scenes, specifically how they install dependencies and run build/start commands. Adding <code>npm install</code> to the Render build step and correctly setting my environment variables fixed the issues. I also switched to using a shared access in <code>MongoDB</code> so that any IP address could connect without being whitelisted.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> Coming from basic <code>JavaScript</code>, thinking in terms of components, props, and reusable UI patterns was a bit new to me. I also had to learn how to handle form state and success/error messages.
                            <br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> I broke the UI into small reusable <code>React</code> components <code>(forms, cards, sections)</code> and used <code>useState</code> to manage input and submission states. This helped me understand component architecture and code organization.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> I started using Flowbite but later decided to remove it to have more control over the design.
                            <br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> I rebuilt <code>buttons</code>, <code>cards</code>, <code>inputs</code>, and <code>layouts</code> using pure <code>Tailwind CSS</code>. This helped me gain confidence in styling and improved the quality and consistency of the final UI.
                        </li>
