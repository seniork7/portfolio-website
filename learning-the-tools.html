            <h2 class="section-title">The Learning Curve</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                One of the most exciting and intimidating parts of being a junior developer is learning the huge range of tools that make modern web development work. It's like stepping into a new workshop where every tool has a specific purpose and every project needs a different combination.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Here's a look into my experience so far.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">React: Learning to Think in Components</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                React felt overwhelming at first. Not because it was "hard," but because the way you think has to change.
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>Breaking UI into components</li>
                <li>Passing props</li>
                <li>Managing state</li>
                <li>Understanding how everything re-renders</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-text">
                As someone who learned vanilla JavaScript first, my initial thought was "why not just write some vanilla JS?" However, the more I understand React, the more I fell in love with it. The component-based approach makes code reusable, maintainable, and so much more organized.
            </p>

        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Node.js: Understanding the Backend Side</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Node.js helped me understand what happens <strong>after</strong> a user submits something in a form or interacts with an app. It opened my eyes to the complete picture of web development.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Learning Node.js taught me:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>How servers work</li>
                <li>How routing works</li>
                <li>How to structure backend logic</li>
                <li>How to respond with data</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-text">
                It made the web feel more complete, like I finally understood the full cycle. Building an API and seeing it interact with a frontend was incredibly rewarding.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">REST APIs: Connecting Everything Together</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Learning REST APIs was the moment where everything started to make sense. Suddenly:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>The frontend wasn't isolated</li>
                <li>The backend wasn't isolated</li>
                <li>Data flowed between the two in a meaningful way</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-text">
                Understanding requests, responses, endpoints, and routes helped me know how real applications communicate behind the scenes. REST APIs are the backbone of modern web applications.
            </p>

        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Biggest Lesson So Far</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Being a junior developer isn't about knowing everything. It's about:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>Learning fast</li>
                <li>Being curious</li>
                <li>Asking the right questions</li>
                <li>Breaking big problems into small ones</li>
                <li>Staying consistent</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-text">
                Every new tool teaches me something, not just technically, but about my approach to problem-solving.
            </p>

        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">What Comes Next</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                I'm continuing to grow in:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>React patterns and hooks</li>
                <li>Vue.js</li>
                <li>REST APIs</li>
                <li>Web accessibility</li>
                <li>Building full-stack applications from scratch</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-text highlight">
                I'm learning to enjoy the process, even when it's messy. <strong>Growth takes time, but I'm moving forward every day.</strong>
